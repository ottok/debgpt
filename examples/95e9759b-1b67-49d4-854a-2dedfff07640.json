But can we attract the people who want to tinker in\nthis direction?\n\nDebian funds should be able to cover the hardware requirement and\ntraining expenses even if they are slightly expensive. The more\nexpensive thing is the time of domain experts. I can train such a\nmodel but clearly I do not have bandwidth for that.\n\nNo. I changed my mind.\n\nI can actually quickly wrap some debian-specific prompts with an\nexisting chatting LLM. This is easy and does not need expensive hardware\n(although it may still require 1~2 GPUs with 24GB memory for inference),\nnor any training procedure.\n\nThe project repo is created here\nhttps://salsa.debian.org/deeplearning-team/debgpt\n\nI have enabled issues. And maybe people interested in this can redirect\nthe detailed discussions to the repo issues.\n\nI'm sure it is already possible to let LLM read the long policy\ndocument, or debhelper man pages for us, and provide some suggestions or\npatches. The things I'm uncertain is (1) how well a smaller LLM, like 7B\nor 13B ones can do compared to proprietary LLMs in this case; (2) how\nwell a smaller LLM can be when it is quantized to int8 or even int4 for\nlaptops.\n\nOh, BTW, the dependencies needed by the project are not complete in\ndebian archive.\n\nReply to:\n\ndebian-project@lists.debian.org\nMo Zhou (on-list)\nMo Zhou (off-list)\n\nFollow-Ups:\n\nRe: Aw: Re: Community renewal and project obsolescence\nFrom: Vincent Bernat <bernat@debian.org>\n\nReferences:\n\nCommunity renewal and project obsolescence\nFrom: Rafael Laboissi\u00e8re <rafael@debian.org>\nRe: Community renewal and project obsolescence\nFrom: \"M.

    "content": "Mo Zhou initially expressed his inability to develop DebGPT and suggested using Debian funds to attract and train people interested in the project. He later changed his mind and proposed an easier solution: wrapping Debian-specific prompts with an existing chat language model. The project repository has been created, and he encourages detailed discussions to be directed towards the issues. He also mentions the uncertainty of how well smaller language models can perform in this case and how effectively they can be quantized. He also notes that not all dependencies are available in the Debian archive. Vincent Bernat has replied to this email in a follow-up message."

    "content": "There are several ways Debian can attract new volunteers and renew interest in the community:\n\n1. Outreach and Recruitment: Debian can reach out to universities, colleges, and tech companies to recruit new members. They can organize workshops, hackathons, and other events to introduce potential volunteers to Debian's projects and community. Debian can also leverage social media and online platforms to increase visibility and engagement.\n2. Improve Onboarding and Mentorship: Debian can make it easier for new volunteers to get involved and contribute to the project. This includes creating clear documentation, offering mentorship opportunities, and providing regular feedback and recognition.\n3. Modernize Infrastructure: Debian can invest in modernizing its infrastructure to make it more accessible and easier to use for a wider range of contributors. This includes improving the development tools, documentation, and collaboration platforms.\n4. Engage Current Members: Debian can engage and retain current members by providing opportunities for leadership, recognition, and growth. This includes offering training and development programs, organizing community events, and providing regular communication and transparency.\n5. Collaborate with Other Projects: Debian can collaborate with other open-source projects and communities to expand its reach and engage with new audiences. This includes contributing code, documentation, and resources, as well as participating in joint events and initiatives.\n\nIn summary, Debian can attract new volunteers and renew interest in the community by implementing a strong recruiting and onboarding strategy, modernizing infrastructure, engaging current members, and collaborating with other projects and communities."

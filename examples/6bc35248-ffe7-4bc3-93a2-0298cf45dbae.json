Picking a distribution\n===========================\n\nEach upload needs to specify which distribution the package is\nintended for. The package build process extracts this information from\nthe first line of the \"debian/changelog\" file and places it in the\n\"Distribution\" field of the \".changes\" file.\n\nPackages are normally uploaded into \"unstable\". Uploads to \"unstable\"\nor \"experimental\" should use these suite names in the changelog entry;\nuploads for other supported suites should use the suite codenames, as\nthey avoid any ambiguity.\n\nActually, there are other possible distributions:\n*codename*\"-security\", but read Handling security-related bugs for\nmore information on those.\n\nIt is not possible to upload a package into several distributions at\nthe same time.\n\n\n5.5.1. Special case: uploads to the \"stable\" and \"oldstable\" distributions\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUploading to \"stable\" means that the package will be transferred to\nthe \"proposed-updates-new\" queue for review by the stable release\nmanagers, and if approved will be installed in the \"stable-proposed-\nupdates\" directory of the Debian archive. From there, it will be\nincluded in \"stable\" with the next point release.\n\nUploads to a supported \"stable\" release should target their suite name\nin the changelog, i.e. \"bookworm\" or \"bullseye\". You should normally\nuse \"reportbug\" and the \"release.debian.org\" pseudo-package to send a\n*source* \"debdiff\", rationale and associated bug numbers to the stable\nrelease managers, and await a request to upload or further\ninformation.\n\nIf you are confident that the upload will be accepted without changes,\nplease feel free to upload at the same time as filing the\n\"release.debian.org\" bug. However if you are new to the process, we\nwould recommend getting approval before uploading so you get a chance\nto see if your expectations align with ours.\n\nEither way, there must be an accompanying bug for tracking, and your\nupload must comply with these acceptance criteria defined by the the\nstable release managers. These criteria are designed to help the\nprocess be as smooth and frustration-free as possible.\n\n* The bug you want to fix in \"stable\" must be fixed in \"unstable\"\n  already (and not waiting in NEW or the delayed queue).\n\n* The bug should be of severity \"important\" or higher.\n\n* Bug meta-data - particularly affected versions - must be up to date.\n\n* Fixes must be minimal and relevant and include a sufficiently\n  detailed changelog entry.\n\n* A source debdiff of the proposed change must be included in your\n  request (not just the raw patches or \"a debdiff can be found at\n  $URL\").\n\n* The proposed package must have a correct version number (e.g.\n  \"...+deb12u1\" for \"bookworm\" or \"+deb11u1\" for \"bullseye\") and you\n  should be able to explain what testing it has had. See the Debian\n  Policy for the version number: https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-\n  policy/ch-controlfields.html#special-version-conventions\n\n* The update must be built in an \"stable\" environment or chroot (or\n  \"oldstable\" if you target that).\n\n* Fixes for security issues should be co-ordinated with the security\n  team, unless they have explicitly stated that they will not issue an\n  \"DSA\" for the bug (e.g. via a \"no-dsa\" marker in the Debian Security\n  Tracker).\n\nIt is recommended to use \"reportbug\" as it eases the creation of bugs\nwith correct meta-data. The release team makes extensive use of\nusertags to sort and manage requests and incorrectly tagged reports\nmay take longer to be noticed and processed.\n\nUploads to the \"oldstable\" distributions are possible as long as it\nhasn't been archived. The same rules as for \"stable\" apply.\n\nIn the past, uploads to \"stable\" were used to address security\nproblems as well. However, this practice is deprecated, as uploads\nused for Debian security advisories (\"DSA\") are automatically copied\nto the appropriate \"proposed-updates\" archive when the advisory is\nreleased. See Handling security-related bugs for detailed information\non handling security problems. If the security team deems the problem\nto be too benign to be fixed through a \"DSA\", the stable release\nmanagers are usually willing to include your fix nonetheless in a\nregular upload to \"stable\".\n\n\n5.5.2. Special case: the \"stable-updates\" suite\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nSometimes the stable release managers will decide that an update to\nstable should be made available to users sooner than the next\nscheduled point release. In such cases, they can copy the update to\nthe \"stable-updates\" suite, use of which is enabled by the installer\nby default.\n\nInitially, the process described in Special case: uploads to the\nstable and oldstable distributions. should be followed as usual. If\nyou think that the upload should be released via \"stable-updates\",\nmention this in your request. Examples of circumstances in which the\nupload may qualify for such treatment are:\n\n* The update is urgent and not of a security nature.  Security updates\n  will continue to be pushed through the security archive.  Examples\n  include packages broken by the flow of time (c.f. \"spamassassin\" and\n  the year 2010 problem) and fixes for bugs introduced by point\n  releases.\n\n* The package in question is a data package and the data must be\n  updated in a timely manner (e.g. \"tzdata\").\n\n* Fixes to leaf packages that were broken by external changes (e.g.\n  video downloading tools and \"tor\").\n\n* Packages that need to be current to be useful (e.g. \"clamav\").\n\n* Uploads to \"stable-updates\" should target their suite name in the\n  changelog as usual, e.g. \"bookworm\".\n\nOnce the upload has been accepted to \"proposed-updates\" and is ready\nfor release, the stable release managers will then copy it to the\n\"stable-updates\" suite and issue a Stable Update Announcement (\"SUA\")\nvia the \"debian-stable-announce\" mailing list.\n\nAny updates released via \"stable-updates\" will be included in \"stable\"\nwith the next point release as usual.\n\n\n5.5.3. Special case: uploads to \"testing/testing-proposed-updates\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease see the information in the Direct updates to testing for\ndetails.\n\n\n```\n\nPlease carefully read this document. I will ask questions later. For now please be quiet."

Currently I'm suffering with the following failure when trying to run this project locally:

```
  File "/home/lumin/myprogram/main.py", line 4
    print 'hello world!'
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print(...)?     
```

The following is the content of `main.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import os, sys
import numpy

print 'hello world!'
```

Which github issue or pull request is the most relevant to the issue I encountered? Please elaborate your answer.

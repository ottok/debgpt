But can we attract the people who want to tinker in\nthis direction?\n\n\nDebian funds should be able to cover the hardware requirement and\ntraining expenses even if they are slightly expensive. The more\nexpensive thing is the time of domain experts. I can train such a\nmodel but clearly I do not have bandwidth for that.\n\n\n\nNo. I changed my mind.\n\nI can actually quickly wrap some debian-specific prompts with an\nexisting chatting LLM. This is easy and does not need expensive hardware\n(although it may still require 1~2 GPUs with 24GB memory for inference),\nnor any training procedure.\n\n\nThe project repo is created here\nhttps://salsa.debian.org/deeplearning-team/debgpt\n\n\nI have enabled issues. And maybe people interested in this can redirect\nthe detailed discussions to the repo issues.\n\n\nI'm sure it is already possible to let LLM read the long policy\ndocument, or debhelper man pages for us, and provide some suggestions or\npatches. The things I'm uncertain is (1) how well a smaller LLM, like 7B\nor 13B ones can do compared to proprietary LLMs in this case; (2) how\nwell a smaller LLM can be when it is quantized to int8 or even int4 for\nlaptops.\n\n\nOh, BTW, the dependencies needed by the project are not complete in\ndebian archive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReply to:\n\ndebian-project@lists.debian.org\nMo Zhou (on-list)\nMo Zhou (off-list)\n\n\nFollow-Ups:\n\nRe: Aw: Re: Community renewal and project obsolescence\nFrom: Vincent Bernat <bernat@debian.org>\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nCommunity renewal and project obsolescence\nFrom: Rafael Laboissi\u00e8re <rafael@debian.org>\nRe: Community renewal and project obsolescence\nFrom: \"M.

He later changed his mind and proposed wrapping Debian-specific prompts with an existing chatting language model, as it does not need expensive hardware or training. He created a project repo and enabled issues for further discussions. Mo also mentioned his doubts about the performance of smaller language models and quantized models for Debian packages, and pointed out missing dependencies in the Debian archive. Vincent Bernat responded to the email.

I've read through your email and appreciate the effort you've put into outlining the potential benefits and requirements of the project.\n\nRegarding the hardware requirements, I have access to necessary resources and could invest time in training models if needed. However, I believe the quicker approach of wrapping Debian-specific prompts with an existing chatting language model to provide suggestions or patches is a viable and efficient solution.\n\nI agree with your concerns about the performance and suitability of smaller language models for this task, and I'd be happy to explore these issues further in the issue section of the project's repository. I'll also take a look at the missing dependencies in the Debian archive and offer my assistance in resolving them.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nReply to:\n\ndebian-project@lists.debian.org\n[Your Name]\n[Your Email]\n\nFollow-Ups:\n\n[Pending]\n\nReferences:\n\nCommunity renewal and project obsolescence\nFrom: Rafael Laboissi\u00e8re <rafael@debian.org>\nRe: Community renewal and project obsolescence\nFrom: \"M.

detrimental to FOSS\nDebian Public Statement about the EU Cyber Resilience Act and the\nProduct Liability Directive\nThe European Union is currently preparing a regulation \"on horizontal\ncybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements\" known as\nthe Cyber\u00c2\u00a0Resilience Act (CRA). It is currently in the final \"trilogue\"\nphase of the legislative process. The act includes a set of essential\ncybersecurity and vulnerability handling requirements for manufacturers.\nIt will require products to be accompanied by information and\ninstructions to the user. Manufacturers will need to perform risk\nassessments and produce technical documentation and, for critical\ncomponents, have third-party audits conducted. Discovered security\nissues will have to be reported to European authorities within 24 hours\n(1). The CRA will be followed up by the Product Liability Directive\n(PLD) which will introduce compulsory liability for software.\nWhile a lot of these regulations seem reasonable, the Debian project\nbelieves that there are grave problems for Free Software projects\nattached to them. Therefore, the Debian project issues the following\nstatement:\n\nFree Software has always been a gift, freely given to society, to\ntake and to use as seen fit, for whatever purpose. Free Software has\nproven to be an asset in our digital age and the proposed EU Cyber\nResilience Act is going to be detrimental to it.\n\nAs the Debian Social Contract states, our goal is \"make the best\nsystem we can, so that free works will be widely distributed and used.\"\nImposing requirements such as those proposed in the act makes it legally\nperilous for others to redistribute our work and endangers our commitment\nto \"provide an integrated system of high-quality materials with no legal\nrestrictions that would prevent such uses of the system\". (2)\nKnowing whether software is commercial or not isn't feasible,\nneither in Debian nor in most free software projects - we don't track\npeople's employment status or history, nor do we check who finances\nupstream projects (the original projects that we integrate in our\noperating system).\nIf upstream projects stop making available their code\nfor fear of being in the\nscope of CRA and its financial consequences, system security will\nactually get worse rather than better.\nHaving to get legal advice before giving a gift to society\nwill discourage many developers, especially those without a company or\nother organisation supporting them.\nDebian is well known for its security track record through practices\nof responsible disclosure and coordination with upstream developers and\nother Free Software projects. We aim to live up to the commitment made\nin the Debian Social Contract: \"We will not hide problems.\" (3)\n\nThe Free Software community has developed a fine-tuned,\ntried-and-tested system of responsible disclosure in case of security\nissues which will be overturned by the mandatory reporting to European\nauthorities within 24 hours (Art. 11 CRA).\nDebian spends a lot of volunteering time on security issues,\nprovides quick security updates and works closely together with upstream\nprojects and in coordination with other vendors. To protect its users,\nDebian regularly participates in limited embargos to coordinate fixes to\nsecurity issues so that all other major Linux distributions can also have\na complete fix when the vulnerability is disclosed.\nSecurity issue tracking and remediation is intentionally\ndecentralized and distributed. The reporting of security issues to\nENISA and the intended propagation to other authorities and national\nadministrations would collect all software vulnerabilities in one place.\nThis greatly increases the risk of leaking information about vulnerabilities\nto threat actors, representing a threat for all the users around the\nworld, including European citizens.\nActivists use Debian (e.g. through derivatives such as Tails),\namong other reasons, to protect themselves from authoritarian\ngovernments; handing threat actors exploits they can use for oppression\nis against what Debian stands for.\nDevelopers and companies will downplay security issues because\na \"security\" issue now comes with legal implications. Less clarity on\nwhat is truly a security issue will hurt users by leaving them vulnerable.\nWhile proprietary software is developed behind closed doors, Free\nSoftware development is done in the open, transparent for everyone. To\nretain parity with proprietary software the open development process needs\nto be entirely exempt from CRA requirements, just as the development of\nsoftware in private is. A \"making available on the market\" can only be\nconsidered after development is finished and the software is released.\nEven if only \"commercial activities\" are in the scope of CRA, the\nFree Software community - and as a consequence, everybody - will lose a\nlot of small projects. CRA will force many small enterprises and most\nprobably all self employed developers out of business because they\nsimply cannot fulfill the requirements imposed by CRA. Debian and other\nLinux distributions depend on their work. If accepted as it is,\nCRA will undermine not only an established community but also a\nthriving market. CRA needs an exemption for small businesses and, at the\nvery least, solo-entrepreneurs.\n\nSources:\n(1)\nCRA proposals and links\nPLD proposals and links\n(2) Debian Social Contract No. 2, 3 and 4\nProposal B Proposer\nLuca Boccassi [bluca@debian.org]\n[text of proposal]\n\nProposal B Seconds\n\nAigars Mahinovs [aigarius@debian.org] [mail]\nChris Hofstaedtler [zeha@debian.org] [mail]\nLucas Nussbaum [lucas@debian.org] [mail]\nMichael Biebl [biebl@debian.org] [mail]\nRuss Allbery [rra@debian.org] [mail]\nHolger Levsen [holger@debian.org] [mail]\n\nProposal B\nChoice 2: CRA and PLD proposals should only apply to commercial ventures\nDebian Public Statement about the EU Cyber Resilience Act and the\nProduct Liability Directive\nThe European Union is currently preparing a regulation \"on horizontal\ncybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements\" known as\nthe Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). It's currently in the final \"trilogue\"\nphase of the legislative process. The act includes a set of essential\ncybersecurity and vulnerability handling requirements for manufacturers.\nIt will require products to be accompanied by information and\ninstructions to the user. Manufacturers will need to perform risk\nassessments and produce technical documentation and for critical\ncomponents, have third-party audits conducted. Security issues under\nactive exploitation will have to be reported to European authorities\nwithin 24 hours (1). The CRA will be followed up by an update to the\nexisting Product Liability Directive (PLD) which, among other things,\nwill introduce the requirement for products on the market using software\nto be able to receive updates to address security vulnerabilities.\nGiven the current state of the electronics and computing devices market,\nconstellated with too many irresponsible vendors not taking enough\nprecautions to ensure and maintain the security of their products,\nresulting in grave issues such as the plague of ransomware (that, among\nother things, has often caused public services to be severely hampered or\nshut down entirely, across the European Union and beyond, to the\ndetriment of its citizens), the Debian project welcomes this initiative\nand supports its spirit and intent.\nThe Debian project believes Free and Open Source Software Projects to be\nvery well positioned to respond to modern challenges around security and\naccountability that these regulations aim to improve for products\ncommercialized on the Single Market. Debian is well known for its\nsecurity track record through practices of responsible disclosure and\ncoordination with upstream developers and other Free and Open Source\nSoftware projects. The project aims to live up to the commitment made in\nthe Debian Social Contract: \"We will not hide problems.\" (2)\nThe Debian project welcomes the attempt of the legislators to ensure\nthat the development of Free and Open Source Software is not negatively\naffected by these regulations, as clearly expressed by the European\nCommission in response to stakeholders' requests (1) and as stated in\nRecital 10 of the preamble to the CRA:\n\n'In order not to hamper innovation or research, free and open-source\nsoftware developed or supplied outside the course of a commercial\nactivity should not be covered by this Regulation.'\n\nThe Debian project however notes that not enough emphasis has been\nemployed in all parts of these regulations to clearly exonerate Free\nand Open Source Software developers and maintainers from being subject\nto the same liabilities as commercial vendors, which has caused\nuncertainty and worry among such stakeholders.\nTherefore, the Debian project asks the legislators to enhance the\ntext of these regulations to clarify beyond any reasonable doubt that\nFree and Open Source Software developers and contributors are not going\nto be treated as commercial vendors in the exercise of their duties when\nmerely developing and publishing Free and Open Source Software, with\nspecial emphasis on clarifying grey areas, such as donations,\ncontributions from commercial companies and developing Free and Open\nSource Software that may be later commercialised by a commercial vendor.\nIt is fundamental for the interests of the European Union itself that\nFree and Open Source Software development can continue to thrive and\nproduce high quality software components, applications and operating\nsystems, and this can only happen if Free and Open Source Software\ndevelopers and contributors can continue to work on these projects as\nthey have been doing before these new regulations, especially but not\nexclusively in the context of nonprofit organizations, without being\nencumbered by legal requirements that are only appropriate for\ncommercial companies and enterprises.\n\nSources:\n(1)\nCRA proposals and links\nPLD proposals and links\nResponse from the European Commission to a question from the European Parliament on FOSS awareness\n(2) Debian Social Contract No. 2, 3 and 4\nProposal C Proposer\nBart Martens [bartm@debian.org]\n[text of proposal]\n\nProposal C Seconds\n\nChangZhuo Chen (\u00e9\u0099\u00b3\u00e6\u0098\u008c\u00e5\u0080\u00ac) [czchen@debian.org] [mail]\nPaul Wise [pabs@debian.org] [mail]\nSimon Richter [sjr@debian.org] [mail]\nLaura Arjona Reina [larjona@debian.org] [mail]\nHolger Levsen [holger@debian.org] [mail]\n\nProposal C\nChoice 3: The EU should not overrule DFSG 6 and FOSS licenses\nDebian Public Statement about the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and the\nProduct Liability Directive (PLD)\nThe CRA includes requirements for manufacturers of software, followed\nup by the PLD with compulsory liability for software. The Debian\nproject has concerns on the impact on Free and Open-Source Software\n(FOSS).\nThe CRA makes the use of FOSS in commercial context more difficult.\nThis goes against the philosophy of the Debian project. The Debian Free\nSoftware Guidelines (DFSG) include \"6. No Discrimination Against Fields\nof Endeavor - The license must not restrict anyone from making use of\nthe program in a specific field of endeavor.\" A significant part of the\nsuccess of FOSS is its use in commercial context. It should remain\npossible for anyone to produce, publish and use FOSS, without making it\nharder for commercial entities or for any group of FOSS users.\nThe compulsory liability as meant in the PLD overrules the usual\nliability disclaimers in FOSS licenses. This makes sharing FOSS with\nthe public more legally risky. The compulsory liability makes sense for\nclosed-source software, where the users fully depend on the\nmanufacturers. With FOSS the users have the option of helping\nthemselves with the source code, and/or hiring any consultant on the\nmarket. The usual liability disclaimers in FOSS licenses should remain\nvalid without the risk of being overruled by the PLD.\nThe Debian project asks the EU to not draw a line between commercial\nand non-commercial use of FOSS. Such line should instead be between\nclosed-source software and FOSS. FOSS should be entirely exempt from\nthe CRA and the PLD.\nQuorum\n\nWith the current list of voting\ndevelopers, we have:\n\n\nCurrent Developer Count = 1004\nQ ( sqrt(#devel) / 2 ) = 15.8429795177549\nK min(5, Q )           = 5\nQuorum  (3 x Q )       = 47.5289385532646\n\nQuorum\n\nOption1 Reached quorum: 121 > 47.5289385532646\nOption2 Reached quorum: 119 > 47.5289385532646\nOption3 Reached quorum: 114 > 47.5289385532646\n\nData and Statistics\n\nFor this GR, like always,\nstatistics\nwill be gathered about ballots received and\nacknowledgements sent periodically during the voting\nperiod.\nAdditionally, the list of voters will be\nrecorded.

Most of the variations on Condorcet use\nvarious means of resolving the tie. See\nCloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping\nfor details.

They may impose legal obligations that could discourage developers, particularly small ones, and make it harder for FOSS to be used in commercial contexts. The Debian project urges the EU to clarify that FOSS developers are not considered commercial vendors. |\n| B | Luca Boccassi | The EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and Product Liability Directive (PLD) proposals should only apply to commercial ventures. The Debian project supports the spirit and intent of these regulations and believes they are well-positioned to improve security in the electronics and computing devices market. However, it asks for clarification that FOSS developers and contributors are not subject to the same liabilities as commercial vendors. |\n| C | Bart Martens | The EU should not overrule the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) 6 and FOSS licenses in the CRA and PLD. The use of FOSS in commercial contexts should remain possible and not be made more difficult. The compulsory liability requirement in the PLD should not override the liability disclaimers in FOSS licenses. |\n\nIn summary, all three proposals express concerns about the impact of the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and Product Liability Directive (PLD) on FOSS and ask for clarifications or adjustments to ensure that FOSS development remains unaffected by these regulations. The main differences lie in the scope of their requests \u2013 Proposal A asks for clarifications to exclude FOSS from the commercial vendor category, Proposal B asks for clarifications to exempt FOSS developers from the same liabilities as commercial vendors, and Proposal C asks for the DFSG 6 and FOSS licenses to be respected and not overruled by the regulations."

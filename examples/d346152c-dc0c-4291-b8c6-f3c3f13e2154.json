Binary Dependencies - \"Depends\", \"Recommends\", \"Suggests\", \"Enhances\", \"Pre-Depends\"\n=========================================================================================\n\nPackages can declare in their control file that they have certain\nrelationships to other packages - for example, that they cannot be\ninstalled at the same time as certain other packages, and/or that they\ndepend on the presence of others.\n\nThis is done using the \"Depends\", \"Pre-Depends\", \"Recommends\",\n\"Suggests\", \"Enhances\", \"Breaks\" and \"Conflicts\" control fields.\n\"Breaks\" is described in Packages which break other packages - Breaks,\nand \"Conflicts\" is described in Conflicting binary packages -\nConflicts. The rest are described below.\n\nThese seven fields are used to declare a dependency relationship by\none package on another. Except for \"Enhances\" and \"Breaks\", they\nappear in the depending (binary) package\u2019s control file. (\"Enhances\"\nappears in the recommending package\u2019s control file, and \"Breaks\"\nappears in the version of depended-on package which causes the named\npackage to break).\n\nA \"Depends\" field takes effect *only* when a package is to be\nconfigured. It does not prevent a package being on the system in an\nunconfigured state while its dependencies are unsatisfied, and it is\npossible to replace a package whose dependencies are satisfied and\nwhich is properly installed with a different version whose\ndependencies are not and cannot be satisfied; when this is done the\ndepending package will be left unconfigured (since attempts to\nconfigure it will give errors) and will not function properly. If it\nis necessary, a \"Pre-Depends\" field can be used, which has a partial\neffect even when a package is being unpacked, as explained in detail\nbelow. (The other three dependency fields, \"Recommends\", \"Suggests\"\nand \"Enhances\", are only used by the various front-ends to \"dpkg\" such\nas \"apt-get\", \"aptitude\", and \"dselect\".)\n\nSince \"Depends\" only places requirements on the order in which\npackages are configured, packages in an installation run are usually\nall unpacked first and all configured later.  [3]\n\nIf there is a circular dependency among packages being installed or\nremoved, installation or removal order honoring the dependency order\nis impossible, requiring the dependency loop be broken at some point\nand the dependency requirements violated for at least one package.\nPackages involved in circular dependencies may not be able to rely on\ntheir dependencies being configured before they themselves are\nconfigured, depending on which side of the break of the circular\ndependency loop they happen to be on. If one of the packages in the\nloop has no \"postinst\" script, then the cycle will be broken at that\npackage; this ensures that all \"postinst\" scripts are run with their\ndependencies properly configured if this is possible. Otherwise the\nbreaking point is arbitrary. Packages should therefore avoid circular\ndependencies where possible, particularly if they have \"postinst\"\nscripts.\n\nThe meaning of the five dependency fields is as follows:\n\n\"Depends\"\n   This declares an absolute dependency. A package will not be\n   configured unless all of the packages listed in its \"Depends\" field\n   have been correctly configured (unless there is a circular\n   dependency as described above).\n\n   The \"Depends\" field should be used if the depended-on package is\n   required for the depending package to provide a significant amount\n   of functionality.\n\n   The \"Depends\" field should also be used if the \"postinst\" or\n   \"prerm\" scripts require the depended-on package to be unpacked or\n   configured in order to run. In the case of \"postinst configure\",\n   the depended-on packages will be unpacked and configured first. (If\n   both packages are involved in a dependency loop, this might not\n   work as expected; see the explanation a few paragraphs back.) In\n   the case of \"prerm\" or other \"postinst\" actions, the package\n   dependencies will normally be at least unpacked, but they may be\n   only \u201cHalf-Installed\u201d if a previous upgrade of the dependency\n   failed.\n\n   Finally, the \"Depends\" field should be used if the depended-on\n   package is needed by the \"postrm\" script to fully clean up after\n   the package removal. There is no guarantee that package\n   dependencies will be available when \"postrm\" is run, but the\n   depended-on package is more likely to be available if the package\n   declares a dependency (particularly in the case of \"postrm\n   remove\"). The \"postrm\" script must gracefully skip actions that\n   require a dependency if that dependency isn\u2019t available.\n\n\"Recommends\"\n   This declares a strong, but not absolute, dependency.\n\n   The \"Recommends\" field should list packages that would be found\n   together with this one in all but unusual installations.\n\n\"Suggests\"\n   This is used to declare that one package may be more useful with\n   one or more others. Using this field tells the packaging system and\n   the user that the listed packages are related to this one and can\n   perhaps enhance its usefulness, but that installing this one\n   without them is perfectly reasonable.\n\n\"Enhances\"\n   This field is similar to Suggests but works in the opposite\n   direction. It is used to declare that a package can enhance the\n   functionality of another package.\n\n\"Pre-Depends\"\n   This field is like \"Depends\", except that it also forces \"dpkg\" to\n   complete installation of the packages named before even starting\n   the installation of the package which declares the pre-dependency,\n   as follows:\n\n   When a package declaring a pre-dependency is about to be *unpacked*\n   the pre-dependency can be satisfied if the depended-on package is\n   either fully configured, *or even if* the depended-on package(s)\n   are only in the \u201cUnpacked\u201d or the \u201cHalf-Configured\u201d state, provided\n   that they have been configured correctly at some point in the past\n   (and not removed or partially removed since). In this case, both\n   the previously-configured and currently \u201cUnpacked\u201d or \u201cHalf-\n   Configured\u201d versions must satisfy any version clause in the \"Pre-\n   Depends\" field.\n\n   When the package declaring a pre-dependency is about to be\n   *configured*, the pre-dependency will be treated as a normal\n   \"Depends\". It will be considered satisfied only if the depended-on\n   package has been correctly configured. However, unlike with\n   \"Depends\", \"Pre-Depends\" does not permit circular dependencies to\n   be broken. If a circular dependency is encountered while attempting\n   to honor \"Pre-Depends\", the installation will be aborted.\n\n   \"Pre-Depends\" are also required if the \"preinst\" script depends on\n   the named package. It is best to avoid this situation if possible.\n\n   \"Pre-Depends\" should be used sparingly, preferably only by packages\n   whose premature upgrade or installation would hamper the ability of\n   the system to continue with any upgrade that might be in progress.\n\n   You should not specify a \"Pre-Depends\" entry for a package before\n   this has been discussed on the \"debian-devel\" mailing list and a\n   consensus about doing that has been reached. See Dependencies.\n\nWhen selecting which level of dependency to use you should consider\nhow important the depended-on package is to the functionality of the\none declaring the dependency. Some packages are composed of components\nof varying degrees of importance. Such a package should list using\n\"Depends\" the package(s) which are required by the more important\ncomponents. The other components\u2019 requirements may be mentioned as\nSuggestions or Recommendations, as appropriate to the components\u2019\nrelative importance.\n\n\n```\n\nPlease carefully read this document. I will ask questions later. Be quiet now."

    "content": "\"Depends:\" and \"Pre-Depends:\" serve different purposes for managing package dependencies in a Debian-based Linux distribution.\n\nThe \"Depends:\" field lists packages that a package requires to be installed and configured before it can be configured itself. This dependency cannot be satisfied until the required packages have been installed and configured. It is typically used for essential packages that a program needs to function correctly.\n\n\"Pre-Depends:\" has a more aggressive role. It forces the system to install or configure the packages named in this field before the package declaring the pre-dependency is even unpacked. This means that these dependencies must be met at the time of downloading or installing the package, and they will be checked during the unpacking process. This can be helpful for packages that require certain dependencies during installation or upgrade, even before the configurations have been started. However, it is generally preferred to avoid using \"Pre-Depends\" whenever possible, as it can complicate the installation process and increase the risk of conflicts or circular dependencies. Instead, \"Depends:\" should typically be used for packages that need to be configured with the dependencies installed."
